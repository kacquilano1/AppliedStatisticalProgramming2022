# integrateIt

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of integrateIt is to approximate numerical integrations using the Trapezoid Rule and Simpson's Rule.

## Installation

You can install the development version of integrateIt from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("johnsontr/AppliedStatisticalProgramming2022")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(integrateIt)
f <- function(x) {sin(x)}
Simpson(a = 0, b = 10, d = 5, f)
Trapezoid(a = 0, b = 10, d = 5, f)
```

The functions will output a numerical estimation for the definite integral approximations.
